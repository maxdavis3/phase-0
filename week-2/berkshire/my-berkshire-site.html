<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
It was great. I really enjoyed it and feel myself becoming a <strong>user</strong>
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
A bit dry to be honest. If it's the only way to learn, I'm game!
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
Well
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
It all seems good so far
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
Remembering the <>'s helps. It's pretty straight forward so far.
