# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection

I learned about meditation techniques. I am especially excited about moving meditation. I have been making a new site for mngrm.com. This involves making about 45,000 renderings of my products. I've noticed the process is calming in its repetitive nature. While working, I am able to quiet my mind and put my complete attention into what I am doing. I also downloaded and started using the Headspace app. Seems appropriate that it is made possible by coding.

"Time Boxing" is a previously agreed period of time during which a person or a team works steadily towards completion of some goal. I currently manage my time by making lists of everything I plan to do for the day. I stay up as long as is needed to complete the list. This works, but often leads to a late start the next morning from staying up too late. I will add time boxing to these lists to manage my time more effectively. I also watched http://pomodorotechnique.com/ (Links to an external site.) and found it very interesting. I will try setting timers on my phone to increase efficient use of time.

In relation to productivity, I learned the power of starting small and the concept of the MVP, or minimum viable product. These are ideas I will put to use when thinking of projects as well as to optimize time spent on them.

As a plan for Phase 0, I will start every day with a 10 minute meditation session using Headspace. Next, I will create a list of everything I need to do for the day. I will then break it into 25 minute increments spaced throughout the day with another meditation session in the middle. At the end of each day, I will reflect as to how accurate I was with my time boxing in order to do better the next day.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection

1. A shell is a program that provides the traditional, text-only user interface for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems.

2. Bash is the shell we've been using.

3. Yes, I was able to successfully use all the commands.

4. I feel cd is very important as we are constantly using it to change through directories as we navigate the shell. I also think the piping commands are very important in their ability to channel inputs and outputs into other commands.

5. pwd - print working directory

ls - list directory

mv - move file or directory

cd - change directory

../ - ensures file exists

touch - changes the access times, modification times, or both, for a file. i also felt it made new files inside the directory

mkdir - make directory

less - page though a file

rmdir - remove directory

rm - remove file

help - get help

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Reflection

Git allows you to save different versions of your work as you go via adds and commits. Git is a version control management tool. It is a fast and modern implementation of version control. It facilitates collaborative changes to files. Github is a social coding website that allows developers to share their code and keep track of their changes using Git. GitHub is a remote entity to which youâ€™re uploading things that would otherwise only exist locally.

Version control is a collaborative history tracking tool that allows users to edit files simultaneously, save versions of the work, and merge their work into a cohesive file.

Developers use git because it is a good way to save progress in a clear and concise manner, showing when, why, and what was changed in each iteration. It also shows who it was changed by. It can save the files in each iteration, so that if anyone needs to go back, nothing is lost and the history is trackable.

A commit is a snapshot of your code that you can go back to at any time. A commit command tells Git that you have made changes and in between the quotes is where you tell Git what you did.
