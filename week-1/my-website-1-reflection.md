Describe what open source means.
Open source software (sometimes called Free and Open Source Software or FOSS) is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made and allowing anyone to customize the program as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I love Open Source. I feel that information should be free. I am against patents because I feel they allow people to sell their ideas and keep them at the same time which is not right. I can 3d model and 3d print anything I'm interested in and I do not feel anyone should keep me from doing so because the information is proprietary. It does feel like utopia.

Assess the importance of using licenses.
When you license your work, youâ€™re not giving away any of your rights. You still hold the original copyright (or patent if you have one) on that work. What a license does is grant specific permissions for others to use that work. Open-source licenses make it easy for others to contribute to a project without having to seek special permission. It also protects you as the original creator, making sure you at least get some credit for your contributions. It also helps to prevent others from claiming your work as their own.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I understood merging a lot better this time. I had an "aha" moment when pushing my information to github, realizing that it was that simple. I struggled with merging, but finally got it. I used to try to merge the folder I was in to the master, but I learned I can merge to feature-branch to the master.
